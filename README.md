# Detecting Fake News with Machine Learning
**Aditya Gupta, Shrihan Tummala** <br>
<br>

In this study, we aimed to find the most effective model for autonomously classifying news as fake or true. <br>
*Research and findings are summarized in the report (.pdf). Code is downloadable via Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).* <br>
<br>

## Abstract
*The abstract will become available following the release of the report after the April exposition.* <br>
<br>

## In-Development
A novel blended learning NLP algorithm is currently being designed to improve accuracy and classification speed based on the results of this experiment. Currently, accuracy is over 98% as the data pool expands. Furthermore, a website allowing users to test whether a selection of contemporary text is fake or authentic is currently being developed to be released sometime in the future. <br>

*All developments related to this project will be published to this repository as soon as they are available, barring any official release restrictions.* <br>
