# Detecting Fake News with Machine Learning


## Overview

In this study, we aimed to find the most effective machine learning model for autonomously classifying news as authentic or falsified journalism. Algorithms tested include **Logistic Regression**, a **Decision Tree Classifier**, a **Random Forest Classifier**, a **Passive-Aggressive Classifier**, and a **Support Vector Machine Classifier**. <br>

*Research and findings are summarized in the report (.pdf). Code is downloadable via Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).* <br>

Focus has now shifted to creating the optimal blended NLP model and expanding it with date sensitivity/estimation, more complex information tagging, a larger variety of data, and designing a website around it allowing users to test information for factuality. Accuracy currently sits at around 98%. <br>

## Fake News
Fake news is...
* A type of disinformation meant to deceive its audience, while looking credible and professional.
* Meant for a specific audience, that generally agrees with it, to incite actions and emotions.
* Created by omitting details, using misleading contexts, or fabricating false information.

Alarmingly, recent studies conducted by Tandoc Jr. et al. (2021) and Hansrajh et al. (2021) found over **71% of Americans distrust most news media**, **59% have shared fake news**, and there is only a **46% chance news is identified correctly** when given equal amounts of fake and true news *(full citations are in the report, pages 24â€“26)* <br>
<br>

*All developments related to this project will be published to this repository as soon as they are available, barring any official release restrictions.* <br>
